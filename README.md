# BigBucksRevisited

## Instructions
Look back in Lesson 42 at the BigBucks Project. Load that project and modify it so that you use
a ListIterator object to add BankAccount objects to the list. Then use the ListIterator object to
iterate through the list and identify the account with the largest balance. The output will be
exactly as it was for the previous project. See the code below for suggested modifications in bold
print.

## Example Code
